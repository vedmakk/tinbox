I would like to <task in one sentence>.

Please implement it according to the design plan in <plan-file.md>

Make sure the plan is up to date if new insights arrise during the implementation and update the plan with changes.

The goal is to execute the plan, while keeping it up to date so in the end, we have the implemented state and the design document serving as both an implementation design plan and a documentation of the implementation we did.
